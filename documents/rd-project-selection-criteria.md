# R&D Project Selection Criteria

*Mosaic Design Labs — Internal Strategic Document*

---

## Purpose

Mosaic operates at the intersection of client services, government-funded research, and internal R&D. We will always have more ideas than we have capacity to pursue. This document defines the criteria and process we use to evaluate which projects to fund as internal R&D initiatives, which to pursue through grants and partnerships, and which to consider for spin-out and incubation.

The goal is not to create a rigid scoring algorithm — judgment and enthusiasm matter — but to make our decision-making transparent and consistent, especially as the team and advisory committee grow.

## What Counts as an R&D Project?

For the purposes of this framework, an R&D project is any internally-initiated effort that is not a direct fee-for-service client engagement. This includes:

- Technology development aimed at creating new products or platforms (e.g., the microfluidic automation controller)
- SBIR/STTR proposals and government-funded research
- Academic collaborations and joint development programs
- Feasibility studies for potential spin-out companies
- Internal tools and automation that improve Mosaic's own operations (when the effort is substantial enough to merit formal tracking)

Client projects are not evaluated through this framework — they have their own intake process. However, client work sometimes surfaces ideas that evolve into R&D projects, and this framework applies once they do.

## Evaluation Criteria

Every candidate R&D project is evaluated across six dimensions. These are weighted by judgment, not by formula — different projects will have different profiles, and that's fine. A project that scores modestly on revenue potential but exceptionally on impact and technical fit may be exactly what we should pursue.

### 1. Technical Fit

*Does this project align with our core capabilities and the technical directions we want to grow in?*

We are strongest at the intersection of hardware, software, and biology — specifically biomedical instrumentation, microfluidics, embedded systems, lab automation, and imaging. Projects that play to these strengths, or that stretch us in directions we deliberately want to grow, score high. Projects that require capabilities far outside our wheelhouse, or that would force us to build infrastructure we don't want to maintain, score low.

Questions to ask:
- Can we staff this with our existing team plus our contractor network, or does it require hiring into a fundamentally new discipline?
- Does this build on or extend technology platforms we've already invested in?
- Will the technical skills developed in this project be reusable across future projects?

### 2. Technical Execution Risk

*Can we actually build this, and how confident are we in the path to get there?*

We are comfortable with technical risk — that's the nature of R&D. But we want to be clear-eyed about where the hard problems are. A project with one or two well-defined technical risks that we can retire through focused experimentation is attractive. A project where we don't even know what the hard problems are yet is more speculative and requires a different level of commitment.

Questions to ask:
- What are the top three technical risks, and do we have a plan to retire each one?
- Is there prior art (academic or commercial) that gives us confidence the approach is feasible?
- What does the prototype roadmap look like — can we get to a meaningful proof of concept in one quarter?

### 3. Market and Regulatory Risk

*Is there a viable path to customers, and what regulatory landscape does this sit in?*

We don't need to do exhaustive market analysis at the project selection stage. But we need to have conviction that someone will pay for this — or that a grant agency will fund it — and we need to understand the regulatory environment well enough to estimate the time and cost to reach market.

Projects in the medical device space carry inherent regulatory risk. We are not afraid of this — it's our domain — but we prioritize approaches that are viable under existing regulatory frameworks (e.g., 510(k) clearance, De Novo classification, or research-use-only positioning) over those that would require novel regulatory pathways.

Questions to ask:
- Who are the first three customers, and have we talked to any of them?
- What's the competitive landscape? Are we differentiated, or are we entering a crowded field?
- What's the expected regulatory classification, and what does the timeline to clearance/authorization look like?
- Are there reimbursement considerations, and if so, what's the path?

### 4. Impact Potential

*If this succeeds, does it matter?*

We are mission-driven in the projects we take on. Impact can take many forms: improving healthcare access, advancing scientific reproducibility, training the next generation of engineers, or creating tools that fundamentally change how research is done. Projects with clear impact narratives are more motivating for the team, more compelling for grant agencies and philanthropic funders, and more aligned with why Mosaic exists.

This criterion also helps us distinguish between "nice to have" projects and ones we'd be proud to have spent years on.

Questions to ask:
- If this product existed today, who would benefit and how?
- Does this address a problem that existing solutions fail to solve, or does it just do the same thing marginally better?
- Can we articulate the impact story in one paragraph for a grant proposal or a blog post?

### 5. IP Potential

*Does this project generate protectable intellectual property?*

Not every project needs to produce a patent. But we should be intentional about building an IP portfolio over time. Projects that create novel methods, devices, or compositions of matter that are protectable strengthen our competitive position, improve our attractiveness to investors and partners, and create assets that can be licensed or contributed to spin-out companies.

Questions to ask:
- Is there a novel invention here — a method, device, or system that doesn't exist in the prior art?
- Would a provisional patent filing be appropriate during or shortly after the feasibility phase?
- Are there freedom-to-operate concerns we should investigate early?

### 6. Revenue Potential

*What's the business model, and how does this project contribute to Mosaic's financial sustainability?*

Revenue might come from direct product sales, licensing, fee-for-service offerings built on the technology, SBIR grants during development, or equity in a spin-out. We don't require every R&D project to have a clear revenue path from day one — some of our most valuable work will be grant-funded basic research that builds capabilities and reputation. But over time, the R&D portfolio should contribute to Mosaic's financial health.

Questions to ask:
- What's the most likely revenue model — product sales, licensing, services, grants, or spin-out equity?
- What's the estimated time to first revenue?
- How much investment is required to reach a revenue-generating milestone?

## Priority Signals

Beyond the six criteria, we give extra weight to projects that exhibit certain characteristics:

**Leverages AI and robotic automation to disrupt existing practices in medicine.** This is where we believe the largest near-term opportunities lie, and it's where our AI-native operating model gives us a structural advantage.

**Builds on existing Mosaic technology platforms.** Projects that extend the microfluidic automation controller, our imaging tools, or our operational software infrastructure compound our prior investments.

**Has a natural academic partnership.** Projects that lend themselves to student projects, joint publications, or collaborative grant proposals generate deal flow, talent pipeline, and credibility simultaneously.

**Is fun.** This is not a throwaway criterion. Projects that excite the team generate better work, attract better talent, and sustain energy through the inevitable hard stretches. If nobody on the team is genuinely enthusiastic about a project, we should question whether it belongs in our portfolio.

## Process

### Proposal

Anyone at Mosaic — founder, employee, intern, advisor — can propose an R&D project. Proposals should be lightweight (one page is fine) and address the six evaluation criteria at a high level. The point is to force clarity of thought, not to create a bureaucratic hurdle.

### Review

The founder reviews all proposals. For significant investments (estimated >$50K or >1 FTE-quarter of effort), proposals are also reviewed by the R&D Advisory Committee (see Advisory Committee Charter). The committee provides feedback and a recommendation but does not have veto authority — final decisions rest with the founder.

### Decision

Projects are approved, deferred, or declined. Approved projects receive a project code, a quarterly objective, an assigned lead, and a budget allocation. Deferred projects are logged in the backlog with a note on what conditions would trigger reconsideration.

### Ongoing Evaluation

Active R&D projects are reviewed at every monthly progress review and quarterly retrospective. If a project is consistently underperforming relative to its objectives, or if the landscape has changed (new competitor, lost funding source, team departure), we revisit the decision. Killing a project that isn't working is not a failure — it's good portfolio management.

## The Dunbar Limit

We would rather focus deeply on a core set of technical, regulatory, and business expertise than try to do everything. We respect the Dunbar limit — there's a natural ceiling on the number of active projects and relationships a small team can sustain without losing quality.

As a rough guideline: MDL should have no more than three to four active internal R&D initiatives at any given time, in addition to its client project load. If a new project is compelling but we're at capacity, something else needs to come off the bench.

We encourage similar companies to copy our business model and innovate in other areas. The goal is not to capture every opportunity — it's to do exceptional work on the ones we choose.

*This framework is a living document. We will revisit and refine these criteria as we gain experience evaluating and executing R&D projects.*
