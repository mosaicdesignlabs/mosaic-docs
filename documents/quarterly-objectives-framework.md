# Quarterly Objectives Framework

*Mosaic Design Labs — Internal Operations Document*

---

## Purpose

Every quarter, we step back and set high-level objectives for the company and for each active project. This isn't a bureaucratic exercise — it's how we make sure the daily grind of client deliverables, lab work, and contractor management stays connected to the bigger picture of what we're building.

This document defines how we set, track, and review quarterly objectives at Mosaic.

## Cadence

| Activity | Timing | Participants |
|---|---|---|
| Quarterly planning session | First week of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) | Founder + all full-time team members |
| Weekly project check-ins | Every week, per project | Project team (internal + client as applicable) |
| Monthly progress review | Mid-month, ~15 minutes per project | Founder + project leads |
| Quarterly retrospective | Last week of each quarter | Founder + all full-time team members |

## Structure

Objectives are set at three levels:

### 1. Company-Level Objectives (3–5 per quarter)

These are the things that matter most for Mosaic as a whole in the coming quarter. They should be concrete enough that at the end of the quarter, we can clearly say whether we achieved them or not.

Company objectives typically fall into a few categories:

- **Revenue and business development** — e.g., close two new client engagements; submit three SBIR proposals; hit $X in quarterly revenue.
- **Internal R&D milestones** — e.g., complete feasibility prototype for microfluidic controller; run first automated cell culture experiment; file provisional patent.
- **Team and operations** — e.g., hire a mechanical engineer; onboard two summer interns; finalize the purchasing SOP.
- **Mission and community** — e.g., host a design review workshop; publish a blog post; establish an academic partnership with a specific lab.

The founder sets company-level objectives with input from the team during the quarterly planning session.

### 2. Project-Level Objectives (2–4 per project per quarter)

Each active project — whether client-funded, grant-funded, or internal R&D — gets its own set of quarterly objectives. These should map to project milestones, deliverables, or key technical risks to be retired.

Project objectives are proposed by the project lead (with input from the project team) and reviewed by the founder during the planning session. They should be specific enough to drive weekly task planning.

Examples:
- Complete V2 prototype assembly and initial bench testing (Project XYZ)
- Deliver Phase 1 feasibility report to client (Project ABC)
- Fabricate and validate three microfluidic chip designs (Internal R&D)

### 3. Personal Development Objectives (1–2 per person per quarter)

Every team member — including the founder — sets one or two personal development goals each quarter. These might involve learning a new tool, deepening expertise in a technical area, improving a soft skill, or contributing to a Mosaic initiative outside their core project work.

Examples:
- Complete an online course on PCB design for RF applications
- Shadow Frankie on two client discovery calls
- Write up a design guide for OnShape assembly best practices

Personal objectives are discussed during the quarterly planning session and revisited during annual reviews.

## How We Track

All quarterly objectives live in Notion, in a dedicated Quarterly Objectives database.

Each objective has the following fields:

- **Title** — A concise statement of the objective
- **Level** — Company / Project / Personal
- **Project** — (if applicable) Which project this belongs to
- **Owner** — The single person responsible for driving this objective
- **Status** — Not Started / In Progress / At Risk / Complete / Deferred
- **Key Results** — 2–3 measurable indicators that tell us whether we achieved the objective
- **Notes** — Running commentary, updated as the quarter progresses

During weekly project meetings, teams reference the quarterly objectives to make sure their task list is aligned. If something is falling behind, that's the time to flag it — not the end of the quarter.

## Quarterly Retrospective

At the end of each quarter, the team meets to review:

1. **What we accomplished.** Walk through each company and project objective. Did we hit it? If not, why?
2. **What we learned.** What surprised us? What would we do differently? What new information changes our trajectory?
3. **What we're carrying forward.** Which incomplete objectives roll into next quarter? Which get dropped because circumstances changed?
4. **How we're working.** Are our processes serving us? Is anything creating unnecessary friction? Are there SOPs we need to create or revise?

The retrospective is also the time to celebrate wins — shipped prototypes, landed contracts, published results, personal milestones. We don't do this often enough, and it matters.

## Guiding Principles

**Be honest about capacity.** It's better to set three objectives and nail all of them than to set eight and finish two. We are a small team working on hard problems. Overcommitting is how we burn out and lose the joy that makes this place work.

**Prioritize ruthlessly.** Not everything can be a priority. The quarterly planning session is where we make the hard calls about what to focus on and — equally important — what to defer or drop. Pruning is an act of discipline, not failure.

**Connect daily work to quarterly goals.** If your task list for the week doesn't obviously connect to a quarterly objective, something is off. Either the task isn't important, or the objectives are missing something.

**Adapt mid-quarter.** The plan is a starting point, not a contract. If a major new opportunity or problem emerges, we adjust. The monthly progress review is the checkpoint for this. When objectives change mid-quarter, we update Notion and communicate the change to the team.

**Default to transparency.** All objectives — company, project, and personal — are visible to the full team in Notion. This isn't about surveillance; it's about making sure everyone understands what we're working toward and can help each other get there.

## Template: Quarterly Planning Session Agenda

**Duration:** 2–3 hours

1. **Review last quarter** (30 min) — Walk through each objective. Score as Complete, Partially Complete, or Not Achieved. Brief discussion of why.
2. **Company-level strategic discussion** (30 min) — What's changed in our business environment? Any new opportunities, threats, or shifts in direction? What matters most for the next 90 days?
3. **Set company objectives** (30 min) — Propose, discuss, and finalize 3–5 company-level objectives with key results.
4. **Set project objectives** (30 min) — Each project lead proposes 2–4 objectives. Group discusses feasibility and interdependencies.
5. **Personal development goals** (15 min) — Each person shares 1–2 development goals. Brief feedback.
6. **Capacity check** (15 min) — Do we have the time and resources to deliver on all of this? Where are the bottlenecks? What needs to give?

*Quarterly objectives are living documents. Update them as you learn. The goal is clarity and alignment, not perfection.*
