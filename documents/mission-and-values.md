# Mission Statement & Core Values

## Mission

Mosaic Design Labs advances technology at the intersection of biology, hardware, and computational intelligence. Our mission is to improve efficiency and access in healthcare, empower patients and researchers, and democratize science — while promoting new models of apprenticeship and hands-on, project-based learning for the next generation of scientists and engineers.

We build great products, great companies, and creative community. We are small but mighty, and we promote a model for 21st-century problem solving through entrepreneurship.

## Why We Exist

We exist because the gap between what technology makes possible and what actually reaches people is too wide. Academic research proves things that don't need to be proven without delivering sustainable solutions. The traditional product development path is slow, expensive, and gatekept by institutions that weren't designed for this era. And the venture capital model, while powerful, systematically ignores problems that don't promise outsized returns — even when those problems affect millions of lives.

We believe a small, disciplined, AI-native team operating at the intersection of for-profit product development and mission-driven research can close that gap faster and cheaper than either the university or the traditional startup can on its own.

We are a for-profit company because we believe in ourselves, we believe in our mission, and we want to scale — to do more in service of that mission. Through nonprofit fiscal sponsorship, we also fund work that is entirely mission-driven. We see these not as separate activities but as parts of a single ecosystem where commercial success funds public good, and public good attracts the kind of people who do exceptional commercial work.

## Core Values

### Curiosity

We are a team of people who want to understand how things work. We ask questions constantly — of our clients, our materials, our assumptions, and ourselves. We don't accept the way things have always been done if we can imagine how they ought to be done. We read widely, learn continuously, and treat every project as an opportunity to expand what we know. If you stop being curious, this isn't the right place for you.

### Creativity

Technology is an art before it is a business. We do this for the love, not just for the money. The most exciting innovations happen at the intersections of disciplines — biology and electronics, user experience and manufacturing, regulatory strategy and automation. We value people who think across boundaries, who bring unexpected perspectives, and who find elegant solutions to messy problems. We don't pigeonhole ourselves into siloed disciplines, and we don't expect you to either.

### Community

We believe that good work happens among people who trust and care for each other. We build real relationships — with our teammates, our clients, our interns, our vendors, and our neighbors. We invest in the people around us because we've learned that if you don't feel love for the people you work with and love from the people you work with, neither you nor the company will thrive. We are building something we want to last for twenty years, and that requires the kind of bonds that survive a bad quarter or a failed experiment.

### Craft

We are technology craftsmen. We take pride in the quality of our work — from the naming conventions in our source code to the tolerances in our mechanical assemblies to the clarity of our lab notebooks. We believe that rigor and documentation aren't overhead; they're what lets a summer intern pick up a project in June that someone else set down in December. We treat our customers' products as our own.

### Courage

Starting a company, changing a field, and building things that have never existed before all require the willingness to be wrong, to look foolish, and to try again. We have the courage to take on hard problems, to be honest when something isn't working, to give and receive direct feedback, and to prune the tree — killing work that isn't bearing fruit so that we can focus on what is. We don't confuse being busy with making progress.

## What We Believe

We believe that the most talented engineers want to work on products that matter, not just products that make money.

We believe that AI will not replace the need for human judgment, creativity, and relationship — but it will free us to spend far more of our time on those things and far less on drudgery.

We believe that the greatest innovations come at the intersection of multiple fields.

We believe that mentorship and education are not side activities but core to how a great engineering organization operates.

We believe that you can build a profitable company without compromising your values — and that doing so attracts exactly the kind of people you want.

We believe that we scale out, not up. If our model works, the best thing we can do is help others replicate it.

We believe that the world will always need good engineers, and good engineers will always need each other.
