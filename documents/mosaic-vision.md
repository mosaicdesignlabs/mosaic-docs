## Where I'm Coming From

I've been building things my whole life. As a teenager I was writing software and dreaming up businesses. In college I joined an underwater robotics club and started a company with a friend, staying up late writing Visual Basic in the same room where I slept. In grad school at UC Berkeley, I traded my music studio gear for a career in bioengineering — a deal I made with myself that I'd bring the creative part of me along, even if the path looked more conventional from the outside. I've kept that promise, though it hasn't always been easy.

My PhD work was in microfluidics and cell biology, and during those years I discovered something important about myself: I wasn't particularly driven by the biological questions themselves, but I was deeply energized by the people who were — scientists chasing discovery, engineers trying to build something that mattered. I loved building tools that made their work possible. That's still what gets me out of bed.

After Berkeley, I stayed on as staff in Professor Dan Fletcher's lab, where we were asking how camera phones could be used to deliver healthcare to underserved populations. The work got a lot of attention, but I grew frustrated. We were proving things that didn't need to be proven and attracting publicity for addressing real problems in the world without actually delivering sustainable solutions. I wanted to stop demonstrating what was possible and start shipping things that made a difference.

So in 2015, I left academia and joined a tiny startup called Lucira Health. Over seven years, I helped build what became the first FDA-authorized at-home COVID test. That was my product. That was my baby. I selected most of our key vendors, helped hire foundational team members, invented major aspects of the technology, prepared our regulatory submissions, and presented to the FDA. I watched the company grow from a handful of people to over a hundred, absorb more than $300 million in investment, and go public.

I also watched how much of that money and time went into activities I knew could be done faster and cheaper. I carried that feeling with me when I left in 2021 to start Mosaic Design Labs.

The last few years of running my own business have been the hardest and most clarifying period of my life. I've made mistakes. I've second-guessed myself constantly — that's what happens when you're a solo founder with no one to tell you whether your ideas make sense. But I've also learned, with more clarity than ever, what I do best, what I love, and what kind of company I want to build.

I call it Mosaic because there are multiple pieces to me, and the company is going to reflect that.

## Where Technology Is Going

We live in an unprecedented time where all of our assumptions about what it means to work, what it means to learn, and what it means to build are being challenged. Most businesses that exist today will not exist in ten years. The ones that remain will be profoundly changed.

The transformer architecture that gave us modern large language models represents something fundamental — not just better autocomplete, but a new interface between humans and computers. Personal computing has always been about developing better ways for people to interact with machines: displays, touchscreens, pointing devices, graphical interfaces. Natural language is the highest level of abstraction, and we've finally arrived there. You can now describe what you want a machine to do, in plain speech, and increasingly it can do it.

What this means for product development is staggering. I spent years doing work that can now be substantially automated: quality management, document versioning, vendor coordination, specifications drafting, test protocol development, board meeting slides, contract generation, even aspects of hardware and software design. The cost and time required to turn ideas into documents, code, and ultimately products has dropped by an order of magnitude, and it's still falling.

But here's what I believe most people are getting wrong about AI: the value isn't in replacing humans. It's in freeing humans to do the work that actually matters — the creative, judgment-intensive, relationship-dependent work that no model can do. Defining the right problem. Earning a customer's trust. Making a hard call about what to build and what to kill. Sitting across from a scientist and understanding, through conversation and intuition, what tool they actually need versus what they think they need.

I subscribe to an abundance vision of the future where more and more people will have the option of not working, or working minimally. In that world, the people who choose to work do so out of genuine joy and love for the work. Those are the people I want at Mosaic.

We also need to be honest about what AI won't change anytime soon. Biology is messy. Cells don't behave like software. Medical devices interact with human bodies in ways that demand physical prototyping, rigorous testing, and regulatory diligence that no shortcut can replace. This is precisely why we focus on technologies at the interface of biology and medicine — because this area of innovation will continue to require a higher proportion of human creativity, hands-on skill, and scientific judgment than almost any other.

## What We're Building

Mosaic Design Labs is a company built for the future around the evergreen business model of innovation. A company built from first principles for a post-AI world. A company that champions creativity, curiosity, and community. A company where good people want to work and work hard to solve problems that matter.

At its core, MDL is a biomedical product development studio. We help clients — startups, researchers, established companies — design, prototype, and bring to market devices and instruments at the intersection of hardware, software, and biology. We write firmware, design circuit boards, lay out microfluidic chips, build embedded systems, run cell biology experiments, and navigate regulatory pathways. What makes us different from the dozens of other product development firms I've worked with over the years is threefold.

**We are AI-native.** This company was built from the ground up with AI tools woven into every layer of how we operate — from project management and proposal generation to code development, document control, and communication. We didn't bolt AI onto an existing workflow. We designed the workflow around it.

**We are unabashedly multidisciplinary.** We don't think in siloed disciplines. We believe the most exciting innovations happen at the intersections — between mechanical engineering and cell biology, between embedded systems and user experience, between regulatory strategy and manufacturing design. We learn what we need to learn, and we expect everyone here to do the same.

**We draw on a global community of talent.** We build our engineering apparatus around a talented pool of freelancers, a broad network of design and manufacturing partners around the world, and a small, highly creative in-house team. This lets us scale up and down with remarkable agility, assemble the right expertise for each project, and keep overhead low enough to take risks on work that excites us.

Unlike a university, our business model is not primarily oriented around education — although we consider education a core part of our mission. And unlike a typical product development firm, our business is not primarily oriented around profit. Through nonprofit fiscal sponsorship, some fraction of our activities are entirely mission-driven. We see these activities not as charity but as force multipliers — they attract the caliber of people we want and keep us connected to the problems that matter most.

The broader vision extends beyond MDL itself. We envision Mosaic Commons as an operating entity for a larger physical space — a shared fabrication studio, community gathering space, and incubator where multiple projects and tenant companies coexist under one roof. We host events, hackathons, ideation sessions. We maintain lab capabilities for cell and molecular biology and cultivate relationships with UC Berkeley and other local institutions. Over time, we'd like this space to include mentorship programs, internships for students and career-changers, and perhaps even a curriculum — a kind of trade school for the next generation of product developers and systems thinkers.

Where other companies scale up, we scale out. If this model is successful, we offer it as a blueprint for others. It doesn't have to be a biomedical studio. It could be a manufacturing business, an investment firm, a policy incubator. But this model of a small, local, mission-driven business with a dedicated team and both a public-facing and a private side — I think it contains the seed of what the company of the future ought to look like.

## How We Work

I want a place that I look forward to coming to every day. I want to enjoy the people I'm around and the kinds of conversations I'm having. I don't want a lot of repetition, because I'm a novelty seeker — I like working on new ideas, learning about new things, thinking at a higher level. And I want to build a company where everyone feels that way about their own role.

A few principles guide how we operate:

**We build the company we want to keep.** Culture isn't something we bolt on after the fact. It starts with the physical space — a lab that feels good to walk into, well-stocked, well-maintained, with room to spread out and think. It extends to how we communicate — directly, honestly, through Slack and Notion rather than email, with the expectation that engineers talk to each other and to the vendors they're designing for, not through layers of management. We default to transparency — shared CAD workspaces, shared notebooks, transcribed meetings, common libraries — because our best work happens at the interfaces between disciplines, and that requires mechanical engineers to see what electrical engineers are doing and vice versa. And it shows up in the work itself: we take on projects we believe in, and we treat our customers' products as our own.

**We are a culture of curious doers.** We get things done, we ask good questions, and we bring creativity to everything we do. We don't just do things the way they've always been done — we imagine from first principles how they ought to be done, and we question assumptions. We are broadly capable and we value people who are willing to learn outside their comfort zone.

**We believe in rigor without bureaucracy.** We are inspired by medical device design control and FDA guidance, and we're moving in the direction of formal compliance. But we don't create process for the sake of process. Every SOP, every template, every design review exists because it makes us faster, not slower. We document our work carefully — lab notebooks, version-controlled designs, transcribed meetings — because good documentation is what lets a summer intern pick up a project in June that someone else set down in December.

**We invest in people.** Learning and skill-building is a core part of our business. We encourage everyone to develop themselves as engineers during their time with us. We support training, certifications, and conference attendance. We pair junior engineers with experienced mentors. We give people real responsibility early. And we maintain relationships with universities so that students, interns, and early-career professionals can find meaningful project work here — the kind of work that actually prepares them for a career in product development, not just a line on a resume.

**We leverage AI relentlessly, but we keep humans in the loop.** AI writes our first drafts, helps us search patent literature during design reviews, summarizes our meetings, and generates our project reports. But a human makes every critical decision. A human signs off on every design. A human sits across from the customer and earns their trust. We are building toward AI-in-the-loop experimental biology — imagine having a conversation with an automated work cell and designing an experiment together — but the scientist's judgment is always sovereign.

## What We Work On

Our technical home is at the interface of biology, medicine, and engineering. The problems we care about most are in healthcare, scientific research, and the tools that enable both.

Our internal R&D revolves around two core technology platforms. The first is a microfluidic automation controller — a generalizable system for precisely controlling fluid delivery in microfluidic chips, enabling automated cell culture, drug screening, and biological assays. The second is a suite of tools for live cell imaging, including automated microscopy workflows that integrate with our microfluidic systems. Together, these platforms position us to collaborate with universities on novel use cases, write SBIR grants, and ultimately develop products that pharmaceutical companies and research labs will use every day.

On the client services side, we take on projects across biomedical devices, lab automation, industrial instrumentation, and occasionally consumer electronics. We specialize in taking a project from concept through feasibility, prototyping, design for manufacturability, and design transfer. We run a structured engagement process — Phase 0 scoping, Phase 1 feasibility, Phase 2 prototype development — and we're honest with clients about what's working and what isn't at every stage.

We evaluate new projects — both internal and external — against a clear set of criteria: technical fit with our capabilities, feasibility of execution, market and regulatory risk, potential for impact, IP potential, and revenue potential. We prioritize projects that leverage readily accessible technology like AI and robotic automation to disrupt existing practices in medicine. And we'd rather focus deeply on a core set of technical, regulatory, and business expertise than try to be everything to everyone. We respect the Dunbar limit.

Some of the broader problem areas we care about, and that we believe technology can meaningfully address, include access to healthcare and disease prevention, reproducibility in scientific research, engineering education and workforce development, and information integrity. Not all of these will be active focus areas from day one. But they represent the north star — the set of problems we'd be proud to have spent our careers working on.

## Why This Matters

I believe deeply in the power of technology to enable ordinary people to do extraordinary things. That's what motivated me to help build an at-home COVID test that anyone could use. It's what drives me to build automation tools that let a single scientist run experiments that used to require a team of technicians. And it's what makes me optimistic about a future where AI doesn't just make companies more profitable — it makes meaningful work accessible to more people.

We are not trying to build a unicorn. We are trying to build a company that can walk and chew gum — incubating ideas, finding funding for them, developing them into real products, and spinning them out into the world. A company that creates more companies. A company that trains the next generation of builders. A company that earns enough to sustain itself and do more in service of its mission.

If you're reading this because you're considering joining us, here's what I want you to know: this company is still early. We're figuring things out. There will be ambiguity and there will be days when the path isn't clear. But there is a vision here, grounded in real experience and real conviction, and I'm looking for people who see something in it that resonates — people who want to build, who care about craft, who are energized by problems that matter, and who believe that we're stronger when we work together.

That's what Mosaic is about. Putting the pieces together.
