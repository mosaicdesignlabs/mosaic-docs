# Mosaic Design Labs — Investor Overview

---

## The Company

Mosaic Design Labs is an AI-native biomedical product development studio based in the San Francisco Bay Area. We help startups, researchers, and established companies design, prototype, and commercialize devices at the intersection of hardware, software, and biology. We also develop our own platform technology for microfluidic automation — tools that will reshape how pharmaceutical companies and academic labs run experiments.

**Founded:** 2021 · **Structure:** Mosaic Engineering LLC (single-member, founder-owned) · **Location:** Berkeley, CA

## Traction

- **4 years** of profitable operating history
- **$700K–$1M+** gross revenue annually, trending toward $1.5–2M
- **~24 clients** served across biomedical diagnostics, lab automation, research instrumentation, and consumer health, including Pfizer
- **SBIR grants** received (NIH); additional proposals in active pipeline across NIH, NSF, ARPA-H
- **50+ customer discovery interviews** completed for microfluidic automation platform through NSF I-Corps
- **Zero debt**, fully self-funded to date

## The Opportunity

Biology is becoming an engineering discipline, and the tools haven't kept up. Drug discovery still runs on manual benchwork, artisanal microfluidics, and inflexible commercial instruments. AI and automation are creating a generational opportunity to change this.

MDL is building **MicroLab** — an open, customizable platform for microfluidic automation that gives researchers the ability to design, fabricate, and automate their own microfluidic experiments. The addressable market spans academic cell biology, organoid drug discovery, cell therapy development, and pharmaceutical screening — collectively a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

We are uniquely positioned because we are not just building a product in this space — we are the engineering firm that clients already come to for this exact problem. Our product roadmap is informed by real customer pain points from dozens of engagements.

## Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Status | Near-Term Potential |
|---|---|---|
| Client engineering services (SOW + retainer) | Active, primary driver | $1.5–2M/yr |
| SBIR/STTR grants (NIH, NSF, ARPA-H, DoD) | Active, growing | $300–750K/yr |
| MicroLab instrument + consumable sales | In development | $500K–1M/yr by Year 3 |
| Expert consulting platform (Mosaic Consulting) | Concept | TBD |

Gross margins on client services run 40–60%. Internal products will carry higher margins at scale, with a consumables model (microfluidic chips) providing recurring revenue.

## What Makes Us Different

**AI-native operations.** Built from the ground up with generative AI, custom automation, and cloud-based engineering tools. We deliver comparable output to firms 5–10x our size.

**We speak bio.** Unlike typical hardware firms, we have wet-lab capabilities, academic partnerships, and hands-on experience with cell culture, microfluidics, and molecular diagnostics.

**Founder-led, mission-driven.** Led by a Lucira Health core inventor (first FDA-authorized at-home COVID test) with 15+ years at the intersection of biology, engineering, and product development.

## The Vision

MDL is the engine of a broader ecosystem: **Mosaic Commons** (shared fabrication studio, incubator, and community space), a **nonprofit** arm for mission-driven global health and education work, and eventually a **seed fund** for incubating biomedical innovations. We scale out, not up — spinning out companies and encouraging others to replicate our model.

---

## The Ask

We are exploring aligned investment of **$1–3M** to accelerate three objectives:

1. **Hire senior technical staff** (2–3 people) to scale project capacity and reduce founder dependency
2. **Accelerate MicroLab** to production-ready prototype within 12 months
3. **Secure a facility** for Mosaic Commons (building acquisition or long-term lease)

We are building this regardless — investment accelerates the timeline by 18–24 months. We are looking for investors who are aligned with the mission, comfortable with a long time horizon, and interested in participating in a new model for innovation.
