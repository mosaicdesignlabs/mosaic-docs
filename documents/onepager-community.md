# Mosaic Commons — For Makers, Students, and Community

---

## A Place to Build Things That Matter

Mosaic Commons is a shared innovation space in the San Francisco Bay Area — part fabrication studio, part incubator, part community hub. It is the public-facing home of Mosaic Design Labs, a biomedical product development company, and a gathering place for engineers, scientists, students, artists, and anyone driven to build.

We believe that in an era of AI and screens, people need physical spaces where they can work with their hands, learn from each other, and solve real problems together. Mosaic Commons is that space.

## What's Here

**Fabrication Studio** · 3D printers, laser cutter, CNC mill, PCB reflow oven, electronics workshop. We're always expanding capabilities — our goal is a full-service prototyping facility for hardware of all kinds.

**Biology Lab** · Automated microscopy, cell culture equipment, liquid handling, and basic molecular biology tools. Core facility partnerships with UC Berkeley extend our capabilities further.

**Community Space** · Room for events, workshops, hackathons, ideation sessions, and informal gathering. A place to share ideas over pizza or present your project to a room full of people who understand what you're building.

**Bench Space** · Dedicated benches for resident projects and tenant companies. If you're incubating a hardware idea and need a home for it, talk to us.

## Who This Is For

**Students and interns.** We partner with UC Berkeley and other universities to offer project-based internships where you work on real products alongside experienced engineers. Our internship program is designed to teach you how product development actually works — not just the theory, but the vendor calls, the tolerance stack-ups, the 3 AM firmware debug. Alumni of our program leave with skills, a portfolio, and a professional network.

**Early-career engineers and career-changers.** If you've finished a PhD and the academic job market feels inhospitable, or you're pivoting from another field into hardware or biotech, we offer mentorship and project opportunities that bridge the gap between education and industry.

**Hardware founders.** If you're building a physical product and need bench space, prototyping tools, and access to experienced engineers who can sanity-check your design — this is your place. We offer informal design reviews, and our team is available for deeper engagements through Mosaic Design Labs.

**Makers and hobbyists.** If you build things because you can't stop building things, you're welcome here. We believe that the best engineers are the ones who also build for fun — art projects, musical instruments, robots, furniture, whatever. The fabrication studio is available for personal projects.

**Community members.** Even if you don't build anything, you're welcome at our events. We host talks, workshops, live streams, and community gatherings on topics ranging from AI and biotech to entrepreneurship, science policy, and the future of work.

## What We Believe

**Curiosity, creativity, community.** These aren't just corporate values — they're the reason this space exists. We believe that innovation happens when diverse people with diverse skills come together in a physical place and work on hard problems with mutual respect and genuine enthusiasm.

**Apprenticeship over credentials.** We care less about where you went to school and more about whether you're willing to learn, build, and teach. We're creating a new model for engineering education — hands-on, project-based, cross-generational, and connected to real-world impact.

**Technology in service of people.** We focus on problems that matter: healthcare access, scientific research, information integrity, and community well-being. We believe engineers have a responsibility to think carefully about what they build and why.

**Scale out, not up.** If this model works, we want others to copy it. We envision a network of spaces like this across the country — small, local, mission-driven innovation hubs where people come to build, learn, and connect.

## Get Involved

**Apply for an internship.** We recruit year-round from UC Berkeley and nationwide. Projects span biomedical devices, microfluidics, embedded systems, and lab automation. Paid positions; flexible schedules for students.

**Attend an event.** Follow us for upcoming hackathons, design review workshops, guest talks, and community nights.

**Propose a project.** Have an idea you want to prototype? A research question you want to explore? A device you want to build? Pitch it to us — we're always looking for interesting problems, and we may be able to help you find funding.

**Become a mentor or advisor.** If you're an experienced engineer, scientist, investor, or entrepreneur and you want to give back, we'd love to have you involved — whether that's reviewing student projects, giving a guest talk, or joining our advisory network.

**Support the mission.** Through our nonprofit fiscal sponsor, tax-deductible contributions support internship stipends, community programming, global health projects, and educational initiatives. Every dollar goes directly to enabling the next generation of builders.
