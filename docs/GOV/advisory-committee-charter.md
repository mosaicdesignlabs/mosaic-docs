# R&D Advisory Committee Charter

*Mosaic Design Labs — Internal Governance Document*

---

## Purpose

The R&D Advisory Committee exists to bring outside expertise, perspective, and accountability to Mosaic's project selection and strategic direction. The committee advises on which R&D initiatives to pursue, helps identify market opportunities and technical risks, facilitates introductions to potential customers, partners, and funders, and provides a sounding board for the founder on questions of strategy, hiring, and organizational development.

The committee is advisory, not governing. Final decisions on project selection, company direction, and resource allocation rest with the founder. The committee's value lies in the quality of its counsel, the breadth of its network, and its willingness to challenge assumptions — not in formal authority.

---

## Composition

The Advisory Committee is composed of five to eight members, drawn from the following constituencies:

### Industry Experts (1–2 members)
Professionals with deep experience in biomedical product development, medical device commercialization, or hardware engineering. These are people who have built and shipped products in our domain and understand the realities of manufacturing, supply chain, and go-to-market execution.

**What we need from them:** Pattern recognition on technical and commercial risks. Introductions to potential manufacturing partners, strategic partners, and customers. Honest feedback on whether our product concepts are viable.

### Investors (1–2 members)
Individuals with experience in seed-stage investing, SBIR/STTR programs, philanthropic funding, or impact investing. They may or may not have a financial stake in Mosaic entities. Their presence ensures that our R&D portfolio is informed by an understanding of what's fundable and what's not — and that we're building toward milestones that create optionality for future financing.

**What we need from them:** Feedback on our project portfolio from a capital allocation perspective. Guidance on fundraising strategy and timing. Connections to other investors and grant programs.

### Academics (1–2 members)
Faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, or research scientists working in fields aligned with Mosaic's technical focus — cell biology, microfluidics, bioengineering, computational biology, or adjacent areas. These advisors keep us connected to the scientific frontier and to the university ecosystem from which we draw talent, partnerships, and ideas.

**What we need from them:** Insight into emerging research trends and unmet needs in their fields. Help identifying collaboration opportunities, joint grant proposals, and student/intern pipeline. Review of the scientific rigor of our internal R&D proposals.

### Public Health and Regulatory Experts (1–2 members)
Professionals with experience in FDA regulatory strategy, global health policy, clinical trial design, health economics, or public health implementation. As a biomedical product company, regulatory and public health considerations are not afterthoughts — they shape which problems are worth solving and which solutions are viable.

**What we need from them:** Early-stage feedback on regulatory classification, pathway to clearance, and reimbursement strategy. Perspective on public health impact and which problems are most worth solving. Connections to clinical sites, public health organizations, and regulatory consultants.

### Clinicians or End Users (0–1 members)
Physicians, lab directors, research scientists, or other practitioners who represent the end users of the technologies we develop. Their perspective grounds our discussions in the realities of clinical and laboratory workflows.

**What we need from them:** User perspective on whether our product concepts address real pain points. Feedback on usability, workflow integration, and adoption barriers. Willingness to participate in customer discovery and early-stage validation.

## Membership

### Appointment
Members are appointed by the founder based on relevance of expertise, alignment with Mosaic's mission, and personal rapport. Recommendations from existing advisors and team members are welcome.

### Term
Advisory committee members serve two-year terms, renewable by mutual agreement. There is no limit on the number of terms a member can serve.

### Compensation
Advisory committee members are not compensated with cash unless a specific consulting arrangement is made for defined work products. The primary forms of compensation are:

- Recognition as a Mosaic advisor (with permission, listed on website and marketing materials)
- First look at investment opportunities in Mosaic-incubated spin-out companies
- Access to Mosaic Commons facilities and events
- The intrinsic satisfaction of helping build something that matters

If Mosaic establishes a seed fund or an advisory equity pool in the future, committee members may be offered participation on terms to be defined at that time.

### Confidentiality
Committee members are expected to treat non-public information about Mosaic's projects, finances, and strategic plans as confidential. A lightweight NDA will be executed upon appointment.

### Conflicts of Interest
Members are expected to disclose any potential conflicts of interest — commercial, financial, or academic — related to projects under review. A conflict does not disqualify a member from participation, but it should be disclosed and noted in the meeting record. Members with direct financial conflicts on a specific project should recuse themselves from the recommendation on that project.

---

## Meetings

### Frequency
The committee meets quarterly, timed to coincide with or shortly follow Mosaic's internal quarterly planning session. This allows the committee to review project performance and advise on the upcoming quarter's priorities.

### Format
Meetings are conducted in person at Mosaic's facilities when possible, or via video conference. Meetings are recorded and transcribed (per Mosaic's standard meeting documentation practices) and summaries are made available in Notion to the Mosaic team.

### Typical Agenda (90 minutes)

1. **Company update** (15 min) — Founder provides a brief overview of business performance, team changes, and strategic developments since the last meeting.
2. **Project portfolio review** (30 min) — Review status of active R&D projects against quarterly objectives. Discuss any projects that are underperforming, need pivoting, or are candidates for termination.
3. **New project proposals** (30 min) — Present any new R&D project proposals for committee feedback. Discussion focuses on the six evaluation criteria (technical fit, execution risk, market/regulatory risk, impact, IP potential, revenue potential).
4. **Strategic discussion** (15 min) — Open-ended discussion on a topic of the founder's choosing. This might be a market trend, a partnership opportunity, a hiring question, a policy issue, or a long-term strategic question.

### Between Meetings
Advisors are welcome to engage with Mosaic between quarterly meetings — reviewing proposals asynchronously, making introductions, or providing ad hoc counsel. This engagement is appreciated but not required. The founder may reach out to individual advisors for targeted input as needed.

---

## Decision-Making

The committee operates by discussion and recommendation, not by vote. After discussion of a project proposal or strategic question, the founder synthesizes the committee's input and makes the final decision. Dissenting views are recorded in the meeting summary and taken seriously — disagreement from a domain expert is a signal to look more carefully, even if the founder ultimately proceeds.

The committee does not have veto authority over any Mosaic decision. The committee does not have governance authority over Mosaic Engineering LLC, Mosaic Commons, or any other Mosaic entity.

---

## Evolution

This charter describes the committee in its initial form. As Mosaic grows, the committee's role may evolve:

- If a seed fund is established, the committee may take on a more formal role in investment decisions, potentially with defined allocation authority.
- If Mosaic Commons grows to include multiple tenant companies, the committee may expand to include representatives from the broader Commons community.
- If a nonprofit board of directors is formed, some advisory committee members may transition to board roles with formal fiduciary responsibilities.

Any changes to the committee's charter, authority, or composition will be made by the founder in consultation with the existing committee.

---

## Initial Recruitment Priorities

For the first cohort of advisors, the founder is prioritizing:

- At least one person with hands-on experience building and commercializing biomedical devices (ideally someone who has navigated FDA clearance for a diagnostic or instrument)
- At least one person with deep knowledge of the SBIR/STTR ecosystem and non-dilutive funding
- At least one academic researcher working in cell biology, microfluidics, or a closely related field — ideally someone open to collaborative grant proposals
- At least one person with a strong investor or business development network in Bay Area biotech

The committee does not need to be fully staffed to begin meeting. Two to three committed advisors is sufficient to start, with additional members recruited over the first year.

*This charter is a living document and will be revised as the committee and the company evolve.*
