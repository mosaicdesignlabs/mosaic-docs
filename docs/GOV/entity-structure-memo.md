# Entity Structure Memo

*Mosaic Design Labs — Internal Strategic Document*
*CONFIDENTIAL — For internal and legal review only*

---

## Overview

The Mosaic ecosystem is designed as a set of complementary legal entities, each serving a distinct purpose but sharing a common mission, physical space, and leadership. This structure reflects a few core convictions: that for-profit and nonprofit activities are simply different tools for advancing the same goals; that owning real estate is essential for long-term stability and community-building; and that the founder's operational control of the core engineering business must be preserved even as the broader organization grows.

This document describes the intended entity structure, ownership philosophy, and relationships between entities. It is intended as a working framework for discussion with legal counsel, potential investors, and key advisors — not as a final legal instrument.

## Entities

### 1. Mosaic Engineering LLC (DBA Mosaic Design Labs)

**What it is:** The core operating company. A single-member LLC, wholly owned by the founder (Frankie Robles), with approximately four years of operating history and consistent gross revenues exceeding $700,000 annually, with projected growth toward $1.5–2M in the near term.

**What it does:** MDL is a biomedical product development studio that provides engineering services to clients (startups, researchers, established companies) and conducts internal R&D. Revenue comes from client services (SOW and retainer engagements), SBIR and other non-dilutive government grants, and eventually from IP licensing and product sales from internal projects.

**Employees and contractors:** MDL employs the in-house team (engineers, technicians, interns, administrative staff) and manages a network of freelance contractors and manufacturing partners. All project-level hiring, vendor management, and client relationships flow through MDL.

**Ownership philosophy:** The founder is reluctant to dilute equity in MDL itself, as sole ownership provides the flexibility to pivot, to set culture, and to make long-term decisions without external pressure to optimize for short-term returns. The preferred model for sharing upside with team members and investors is at the project and fund level (see below), not through equity in the parent LLC.

That said, the founder is open to conversations about equity sharing under the right circumstances — particularly if a co-founder or senior partner emerges who is deeply aligned with the mission and willing to share the burden of building the organization. Any such arrangement would be structured carefully to preserve the founder's managing authority over the company's direction and culture.

**Potential future structure:** If the company raises venture capital for a specific product line (e.g., a microfluidic automation platform), that effort would be structured as a spin-out entity — a separate company incubated within Mosaic. MDL would retain ownership stake and potentially negotiate to retain physical assets (lab, equipment) in the event the spin-out fails.

### 2. Mosaic Commons

**What it is:** An operating company (LLC or similar) for the larger physical space in which MDL and other entities are tenants.

**What it does:** Mosaic Commons manages the shared facility, which includes:

- **Shared fabrication studio** — 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC mills, PCB reflow oven, potentially a small SMT line and clean room. Available to MDL and all tenant companies. Capabilities grow over time.
- **Cell and molecular biology lab** — Bench space, automated microscopy, liquid handlers, incubators, centrifuges, and basic molecular biology equipment. Maintained relationships with UC Berkeley core facilities and local biotech incubators for expanded capabilities.
- **Community and event space** — For hackathons, ideation sessions, community events, workshops, live streams, and potentially interfaith or wellness programming.
- **Tenant offices** — Leased to incubated companies, visiting researchers, or compatible small businesses.

Depending on venue and investor interest, the space may also include a café, conference rooms, exhibit hall, library, or auditorium.

**Revenue model:** Tenant leases, event programming, membership fees for fabrication studio access, and potentially fee-for-service lab work.

**Location:** San Francisco Bay Area, preferably downtown San Francisco or Berkeley. Other locations may be considered.

### 3. Mosaic Property Holdings (or building-specific LLC)

**What it is:** A property holding company that purchases and owns the building housing the Commons and MDL.

**Why it exists:** Owning the building eliminates landlord risk, allows long-term investment in facility improvements, and sends a signal of permanence to the community, team, and partners. The founder's strong preference is to avoid the scenario where years of community-building are disrupted by a landlord selling the property.

**Ownership structure:** The property holding company would have multiple investors/owners structured as limited partners, with the founder (or Mosaic Engineering LLC) as the sole managing partner or one of a small number of managing partners. The founder's strong preference is to be the sole GP to maintain decision-making authority over the physical space.

**Investor terms (preliminary framework):**

- LP investors contribute capital toward down payment and/or building improvements.
- Returns are benchmarked against the SBA loan rate — the logic being that if investors weren't participating, the company would finance the purchase through an SBA loan. Investors shouldn't expect venture-style returns; they should be aligned with the mission and comfortable parking capital in Bay Area real estate with a stable, mission-driven tenant.
- A liquidity event at five years allows investors to exit. Valuation would be based on a professional appraisal at that time. A modest early-withdrawal fee discourages short-term speculation.
- If investor interest is high enough to enable an all-cash purchase (avoiding an SBA loan entirely), that benefits everyone through lower monthly costs and potentially a better acquisition price.
- Rent charged to MDL and other tenants is set to be "kind to the company" — below market rate, with the understanding that the building's success is tied to the company's success. Surplus revenue from the company is reinvested into growth and mission-aligned activities, not extracted as profit.

**Potential expansion:** The holding company could eventually own additional properties — a rural retreat property for events and team gatherings, additional urban locations, or satellite centers in other cities.

### 4. Nonprofit Fiscal Sponsorship

**What it is:** A 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity (or fiscal sponsorship arrangement with an existing nonprofit) that receives tax-deductible contributions from community members, philanthropic organizations, and potentially large technology companies or foundations (e.g., Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, or similar).

**What it funds:** Nonprofit dollars are earmarked for mission-driven activities that are not primarily revenue-generating:

- Global health projects and health tech innovations intended to be sold at cost or distributed freely
- Nonprofit spin-outs
- Education workshops, training retreats, maker bootcamps
- Internship and apprenticeship stipends (including for career-changers and non-traditional students)
- Artist-in-residence program
- Basic research projects and academic collaborations
- Science communication, policy engagement, and community programming

**Governance:** The nonprofit would be managed by a board of directors composed of the founder and trusted advisors. Any equipment purchased with nonprofit funds is tagged and inventoried separately. IP developed with nonprofit funds is partitioned from commercial IP and handled according to the nonprofit's charter.

**Relationship to MDL:** The nonprofit may fund specific projects executed within MDL's facilities, using MDL's equipment and personnel. This is tracked and managed appropriately, with clear separation between commercial and mission-funded activities. The model is similar to how a university lab might receive both industry funding and NIH grants — different funding sources supporting different objectives within the same infrastructure.

---

### 5. Future: Mosaic Seed Fund

**What it is:** An internal investment fund, potentially structured as a separate entity, that evaluates and funds early-stage projects aligned with Mosaic's technical competencies.

**How it works:** Projects are pitched to the fund (and potentially to outside investors). Funded projects are incubated within Mosaic Commons, benefiting from the full suite of MDL engineering capabilities, lab infrastructure, advisory network, and operational support. Successful projects are spun out as independent companies.

**Participation:** Rather than granting equity in MDL itself, the fund structure allows team members, advisors, and investors to participate in the upside of individual projects. This preserves the founder's ownership of the core company while creating meaningful incentive alignment around specific ventures.

**Timeline:** The seed fund is a medium-term aspiration. The prerequisite is that MDL has demonstrated a track record of successful project development, the advisory committee is established, and there is sufficient deal flow and investor interest to make the fund viable.

```

The key principle is that MDL is the engine. It generates revenue through client services and grants. It builds the technology, trains the team, and develops the IP. The other entities exist to support, house, fund, and scale the activities that MDL makes possible — and to create pathways for mission-driven work that a purely commercial entity couldn't justify.

## Open Questions for Legal Counsel

1. What is the optimal legal structure for Mosaic Commons — LLC, benefit corporation, or something else?
2. Should the nonprofit be a standalone 501(c)(3) or a fiscal sponsorship arrangement with an existing organization? What are the tradeoffs in terms of governance, fundraising flexibility, and administrative burden?
3. How should IP developed with mixed funding (e.g., partly nonprofit, partly commercial) be partitioned and managed?
4. What are the implications of MDL (a for-profit LLC) being the managing partner of the property holding company? Are there self-dealing concerns?
5. For the seed fund: what structure best allows team members and outside investors to participate in project-level upside without diluting MDL equity?
6. What governance obligations come with each entity, and how do we minimize administrative overhead while maintaining compliance?
7. What protections should be in place to ensure that if a VC-backed spin-out fails, MDL retains its physical assets (lab equipment, facility improvements)?
