# Mosaic Design Labs — For Engineers

---

## Build Things That Matter. Learn Every Day. Work With People You Respect.

Mosaic Design Labs is a biomedical product development studio in Berkeley, CA. We design, prototype, and bring to market devices and instruments at the intersection of hardware, software, and biology — for clients ranging from pre-seed startups to companies like Pfizer, and through our own internal R&D in microfluidic automation and tools for cell biology.

We are a small team that does big work. If you want to build real products, work across disciplines, and grow fast in an environment that respects your time and your intelligence, keep reading.

## What You'd Work On

Our projects span biomedical diagnostics, research instrumentation, lab automation, microfluidics, embedded systems, and occasionally consumer electronics. No two projects look the same. Recent and representative work includes:

- Custom imaging systems for clinical wound assessment
- Microfluidic chip design and automated cell culture platforms
- Foodborne pathogen diagnostic cartridge development
- LabVIEW and firmware for connected analytical instruments
- Pressure controllers and valve systems for microfluidic automation
- Grant-funded R&D in organ-on-chip and drug discovery tools

You would also have the opportunity to contribute to our internal platform — the MicroLab — an open microfluidic automation system aimed at reshaping how researchers run experiments. This is our biggest bet, and the team that builds it will shape a product with the potential to reach every biology lab in the world.

## How We Work

**You get real responsibility from day one.** We don't have layers of management. You work directly with the founder and a small team of peers. You own your designs, run your experiments, talk to vendors, and present to clients. We trust you to take responsibility for your work, and we give you the support to succeed.

**We are AI-native.** We use generative AI and custom automation across every part of the business — from drafting specifications and test protocols to writing firmware, generating project reports, and managing documentation. You'll be expected to use these tools fluently and help us push the boundary of what a small team can accomplish.

**We don't reinvent the wheel.** We maintain standardized design guides, preferred architectures, common component libraries, and reusable templates across embedded systems, PCBs, mechanical assemblies, software, and microfluidics. When you start a new project, you're building on a foundation, not starting from scratch. And when you develop something better, we fold it back into the guides for the next person.

**We are rigorous without being bureaucratic.** We are inspired by medical device design control. We document our work carefully — lab notebooks, version-controlled designs, transcribed meetings — because good documentation is what makes a team more than a collection of individuals. But every process we maintain exists because it makes us faster, not slower.

## Your Tools

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| CAD | OnShape (primary), SolidWorks |
| PCB Design | Altium Designer |
| Software | Cursor, VS Code, Python, C/C++, Git |
| Simulation | COMSOL Multiphysics |
| Project Management | Notion |
| Communication | Slack (strongly preferred over email) |
| Fabrication | 3D printers, laser cutter, CNC mill, PCB reflow, blade cutter |
| Biology | Automated microscope, qPCR, liquid handler, incubators, spectrophotometer |
| AI | Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, custom automation pipelines |

We are always evaluating new tools. If you find something better, make the case and we'll try it.

## What We Offer

**Variety.** You will work on multiple projects across disciplines. If you're the kind of engineer who gets bored doing the same thing for two years, you'll thrive here. Most of our engagements last weeks to months, not years.

**Mentorship.** Our founder has 15+ years of experience across microfluidics, biomedical instrumentation, product development, and manufacturing — including seven years as a core inventor at Lucira Health (first FDA-authorized at-home COVID test). He has turned down faculty offers and has taught engineering at the university level. You will learn from someone who has done the work, not just managed it.

**Growth.** We actively support your development. Training, certifications, conference attendance, and on-the-job learning are all part of the deal. We set personal development objectives every quarter and review them honestly. We want the time you spend at Mosaic to be a launchpad for your career, whether that means growing with us or going on to start your own company.

**Creative latitude.** We encourage experimentation, hobby projects, and play. Our lab and fabrication studio are available for personal projects. We believe the best engineers are the ones who also build for fun — and we want to see what you make.

**Mission.** We are selective about the projects we take on. We focus on work with real-world impact potential — healthcare, scientific research, tools that empower people. You will not spend your career optimizing ad clicks. You'll build devices that go into clinics, labs, and the hands of researchers trying to cure diseases.

**Flexibility.** We value independence and efficiency. We care about what you deliver, not when you're sitting in a chair. Schedules are flexible. Remote work is possible for many roles, though the lab is where the magic happens and we expect you there regularly.

## Who We're Looking For

We hire across experience levels — interns, early-career engineers, mid-career specialists, and senior contractors. What's consistent is the profile:

**Curious.** You learn things because you want to, not because someone assigned them. You ask questions. You read outside your discipline.

**Resourceful.** You figure things out. When the datasheet doesn't have the answer, you design an experiment, call the vendor, or build a test fixture. You don't wait for instructions.

**Multidisciplinary.** You're comfortable working at interfaces — mechanical and electrical, hardware and software, engineering and biology. You don't say "that's not my job." You may not know everything, but you're willing to learn.

**Careful.** You document your work. You name your files consistently. You leave a project in a state where someone else can pick it up. You take pride in the craft, not just the result.

**Direct.** You communicate honestly. You flag problems early. You give and receive feedback without drama. You prefer Slack over email and conversation over ambiguity.

---

## Types of Roles

**Full-time engineers.** Mechanical, electrical, firmware, software, or multidisciplinary. You join the core team, work across projects, and help shape the company's technical direction. Competitive salary, equity discussion for senior roles, learning budget, flexible schedule.

**Contract engineers.** Project-based engagements for specialists — PCB layout, firmware, mechanical design, biology, regulatory, manufacturing. We maintain long-term relationships with contractors and often re-engage for new projects. Competitive rates; we pay on time.

**Interns.** Semester or summer appointments, primarily from UC Berkeley but open to students nationwide. You work on real projects with real deliverables — not busywork. Paid positions. Past interns have contributed to client deliverables, co-authored grant proposals, and built portfolio projects that launched careers.

## A Note on Who We Are

We are a culture of curious doers. We get things done, we ask good questions, and we bring creativity to everything we do. We don't do things the way they've always been done — we imagine from first principles how they ought to be done, and we question assumptions. We believe that the world will always need good engineers, and good engineers will always need each other.

If that sounds like the kind of place where you'd do your best work, we'd like to hear from you.
