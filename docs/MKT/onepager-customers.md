# Mosaic Design Labs — For Development Partners and Clients

---

## Your Engineering Team, When You Need One

Mosaic Design Labs is a biomedical product development studio based in Berkeley, CA. We partner with startups, researchers, and established companies to take hardware and software products from concept through prototyping, design for manufacturing, and regulatory preparation — with a specialty in devices at the intersection of biology, electronics, and software.

You hire us when you need a team that can build the thing, not just advise on it.

## How We Work

We follow a phased engagement model designed to retire risk early and keep you in control of scope and budget:

**Phase 0 — Scoping** · We help you define the problem, assess technical feasibility, identify the right team, and put together a development plan. Typical duration: 2–4 weeks.

**Phase 1 — Feasibility** · We build proof-of-concept prototypes targeting your biggest technical risks. You get a clear feasibility report with a go/no-go recommendation. Typical duration: 2–4 months.

**Phase 2 — Development** · We deliver production-intent prototypes — looks-like, works-like, is-like — along with design for manufacturability, production documentation, and support through design transfer. Duration: varies by complexity.

We price projects on a **milestone basis**, not time and materials. We agree on scope and deliverables up front, and we don't nickel and dime. For ongoing relationships, we also offer **monthly retainer** arrangements.

## What We Build

**Biomedical devices and diagnostics** · Point-of-care instruments, imaging systems, sample-to-answer cartridges, wearable sensors

**Research instrumentation** · Automated microscopy, microfluidic platforms, custom optical systems, analytical instruments

**Lab automation** · Liquid handling, cell culture automation, robotic workflows, instrument integration

**Embedded systems** · Firmware, connected devices, motor control, sensor integration, data pipelines

**Microfluidics** · Chip design, soft lithography fabrication, manifold design, reagent delivery systems

We also support **grant writing and technical strategy** — particularly SBIR/STTR proposals — and can help you develop the technical narrative for your funding applications.

## What Makes Us Different

**We're not a big consultancy.** You work directly with our founder and a small, senior team. No hand-offs to junior staff you've never met.

**We speak bio.** We have our own cell biology lab, fabrication studio, and core facility access at UC Berkeley. We can prototype your assay, not just your housing.

**We move fast.** AI-native workflows, a global network of specialist contractors, and standardized design templates mean we deliver in weeks what conventional firms quote in months.

**We've been where you're going.** Our founder helped build the first FDA-authorized at-home COVID test from early R&D through manufacturing scale-up. We understand the full product lifecycle — not just the part we're hired for.

**We help you get funded.** We have experience writing and winning SBIR grants and can help you develop proposals, budgets, and technical plans for government and investor funding.

## Who We Work Best With

We do our best work with clients who look to us to lead product design and technical architecture — scientists, clinicians, and software founders navigating hardware for the first time. We thrive when there is creative latitude to innovate and when the problem genuinely matters.

We have served clients ranging from pre-seed startups to established companies including Pfizer, across biomedical diagnostics, research tools, industrial controls, and consumer health.

## Our Lab

Located in Berkeley, CA, our facility includes:

- Fabrication studio (3D printers, laser cutter, CNC mill, PCB reflow)
- Electronics workshop (full test and measurement equipment)
- Cell biology lab (automated microscope, qPCR, liquid handler, incubators)
- Four to five lab benches supporting concurrent projects
- UC Berkeley core facility membership for extended capabilities

## Let's Talk

If you're building something at the intersection of biology, hardware, and software — and you want a partner who treats your product as their own — we'd like to hear from you.
